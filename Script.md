## Plot

Larry woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally Larry would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Larry’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Larry had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Larry would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Larry finally landed to the small and cozy intestine. "I want to go home", cried Larry.
Suddenly a magical unicorn king ruptured through the rectum and came to Larry.
"Cry no more, dear boy. I know the way out!" exclaimed the Unicorn King. "Sit on my Horn!"
Larry carefully placed his bottom on the magical beast, and immediately died of pleasure.
"Welcome Home", said the Unicorn king as he ate Larry's remains.
